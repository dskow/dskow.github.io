title: Using Jispter to build your project scaffolding  
---

Jsipter is a great tool to generate an integrated scaffolding for a set of Open APi, Spring Boot, Angular, and docker-compose.  

It is a generator of [Yeoman] (https://yeoman.io/learning/) which is built on from [npm] (https://www.npmjs.com/).

It is stable with Java 8 on Ubuntu 16.04 and with Java 11 on Ubuntu 18.10

To use just type `jhipster` and it will create your files in your current directory based on your menu choices.  By default it uses a series of command line menus to initialize your Application

There are 4 types of Applications that can be generated.

1. Monolithic application (recommended for simple projects)
2. Microservice application
3. Microservice gateway
4. JHipster UAA server (for microservice OAuth2 authentication)

During the execution of the jhipster command, it will also give instruction to any maintenance commands that should be run outside of the application.

Here are some example messages.

️⚠️  WARNING ⚠️  You are in your HOME folder!
This can cause problems, you should always create a new directory and run the jhipster command from here.
